Here’s a breakdown of the fields from the Molène dataset:

1. **`numer_sta`**: Station number or identifier. It uniquely identifies the meteorological station where the data was recorded.

2. **`date`**: Timestamp of the recorded data, typically in a standard format like YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.

3. **`date_insert`**: Timestamp of when the data was inserted into the database. This is often used for traceability.

4. **`td`**: Dew point temperature (°C). It indicates the temperature to which air must be cooled for water vapor to condense into dew.

5. **`t`**: Air temperature (°C). This is the ambient temperature measured at the station.

6. **`tx`**: Maximum air temperature (°C) during the observed period.

7. **`tn`**: Minimum air temperature (°C) during the observed period.

8. **`u`**: Relative humidity (%). Indicates the amount of moisture in the air relative to the maximum moisture it can hold at a given temperature.

9. **`ux`**: Maximum relative humidity (%) during the observed period.

10. **`un`**: Minimum relative humidity (%) during the observed period.

11. **`dd`**: Wind direction (°). Typically measured in degrees from true north.

12. **`ff`**: Average wind speed (m/s).

13. **`dxy`**: Wind direction variability (°). Represents fluctuations in wind direction over the observed period.

14. **`fxy`**: Wind speed variability (m/s). Represents fluctuations in wind speed over the observed period.

15. **`dxi`**: Maximum wind direction (°) recorded during the period.

16. **`fxi`**: Maximum wind speed (m/s) recorded during the period.

17. **`rr1`**: Rainfall (mm) in the last hour. This is a precipitation measure.

18. **`t_10`**: Air temperature (°C) at 10 cm above ground level.

19. **`t_20`**: Air temperature (°C) at 20 cm above ground level.

20. **`t_50`**: Air temperature (°C) at 50 cm above ground level.

21. **`t_100`**: Air temperature (°C) at 100 cm (1 meter) above ground level.

22. **`vv`**: Horizontal visibility (m). Indicates how far an observer can see horizontally in the atmosphere.

23. **`etat_sol`**: Surface condition or ground state (categorical). It describes conditions like dry, wet, frozen, etc.

24. **`sss`**: Soil temperature (°C). This is the temperature of the soil, often measured at a specific depth.

25. **`n`**: Cloud cover (octas). Represents the fraction of the sky covered by clouds, with 0 being clear skies and 8 being fully overcast.

26. **`insolh`**: Sunshine duration (hours). Measures how many hours of sunshine were observed.

27. **`ray_glo01`**: Global radiation (W/m²). Represents the total incoming solar radiation received at the station.

28. **`pres`**: Station-level atmospheric pressure (hPa). Measured at the elevation of the station.

29. **`pmer`**: Sea-level atmospheric pressure (hPa). Corrected to sea level to allow comparison between stations at different altitudes.
